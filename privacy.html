              To enhance the functionality and user-friendliness of the Platform
              for Our Users, We employ "cookies" and similar digital mechanisms
              to gather data, assigning each visitor a distinct, anonymous
              identifier as a User Identification (User ID) to ascertain the
              User's specific interests via the identified device. Unless a User
              chooses to reveal their identity (for instance, by registering),
              Dhan Dhoom has no means to recognize the User, even if We allocate
              a cookie to the User's device. A cookie can only hold data
              provided by the User and is incapable of extracting information
              from the User's device hard drive. Advertisers on Dhan Dhoom may
              also set their own cookies on the User's device when the User
              engages with their advertisements, a practice over which Dhan
              Dhoom has no oversight.

              address, during the User's interaction with the Platform. (An IP
              address is a numeric code that enables internet-connected devices
              to direct data, such as web pages the User requests, to the User).
              The User's IP address does not personally identify the User. Dhan
              Dhoom utilizes this information to serve web pages to Users upon
              request, customize its Platform based on User interests, assess
              traffic within the Platform, and inform advertisers of the
              geographic locations of Dhan Dhoom's visitors.
