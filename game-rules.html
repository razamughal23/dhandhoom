              points in that Contest if the chosen DD Card does not play.

              In the rare event that we settle a Contest incorrectly, we will
              look into the matter promptly and resettle the Contest correctly.
              The leaderboard will be updated to reflect any resettlement and,
              if it is a Public Contest which includes prizes, those prizes may
              be debited / credited from users to reflect the resettlement, if
              applicable. If you think we have made an error with settlement
              which has not been corrected then please let our Customer Service
              team know at
              <a href="mailto:support@dhandhoom.com">support@dhandhoom.com</a>
